OBJECTIVE
=========

I am excited about the opportunity to build and grow a product from the
ground up while managing and teaching a team of developers to be
forward-thinking in their field.

In 2010 I co-founded a full-service consultancy. I’ve been happy with
the broad experience I’ve gained using many different technologies and
spanning multiple industries as well as gaining valuable experience
growing teams and products. Growing my own business has also given me
the experience of managing relationships with clients and being
intimately involved in the day-to-day operations of an LLC.

I am now ready to focus on iterating a product and helping it flourish
in the market.
