\section{OBJECTIVE}

    I am excited about the opportunity to build and grow a product from the
    ground up while managing and teaching a team of developers to be
    forward-thinking in their field.

    In 2010 I co-founded a full-service consultancy. I've been happy with the
    broad experience I've gained using many different technologies and
    spanning multiple industries as well as gaining valuable experience
    growing teams and products. Growing my own business has also given me the
    experience of managing relationships with clients and being intimately
    involved in the day-to-day operations of an LLC.

    I am now ready to focus on iterating a product and helping it flourish in
    the market.
